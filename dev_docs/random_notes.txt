To reset accounts/transfers during testing we can use an HTTP request similar to:
    (shell script)
    $ wget -O - http://localhost:3001/developerTesting/reset
    
    o using nodeJS (five-bells-ledger tests) something similar to:
    await this.request()
        .get("/developerTesting/reset")                                                                                                                                                                       
        .expect(200)
