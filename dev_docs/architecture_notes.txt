- Coding Style:
---------------

   - Inmutable by default code makes code much more resiliant to errors.
     class instances are defined at contruction time, and internal members declared final.
     The compiler will neglect to compile if it detects that a class member can be 
     un-initialized.

   - Avoid nulls everywhere. No variable takes a null value unless a very good reason
     exists for that (note: there is never a good reason).
     - Never ever return null!!!. Launch exception if the code can't return a valid sensible
       value.
     - Never ever use null to mark a variable as un-initialized. Think twice and use
       a sensible default value or declare the variable later on when the code has all the
       data to initialize it properly. If at the time of writting we don't know what to
       assign except a null mark the code with // FIXME, TODO:(0) Remove null

   - Fail fast: As soon as the code notices something abnormal an (Interledger) Exception
     is raised. Code doesn't try to continue in case of any minor/major error. 
   
   - Use TODO:(0) to mark tasks in code that must be fixed.
   - Use TODO:(1) to mark tasks in code that can be left as improvements.
   - Use TODO:(RFC)|TODO:(ILP) to mark things that must be discusses with the Interledger community
   - Use TODO:(core) to mark things that could(/must) be placed in java-ilp-core

SubPackages of org.interledger.everledger:
------------------------------------------
   
   - ...everledger.handlers:
     Contains the handle classes in charge of parsing input 
     HTTP request from clients.
     
   - ...everledger.ifaces:
     Contains interfaces that must be implemented by concrete clases.
     For each entity (informally speaking an entity is anything that
     can be mentally mapped to a row in a database, that is, it contains
     an unique id) we will define varios interfaces:
       - Entity Interfaces:
         - IfaceLocal"Entity": Defines the getters with data that can be
           stored in the entity. Notice that since we use inmutable code
           there will ussually not be getters. All initialization must
           be done in the constructor (or fail-fast and throw an exception
           if the constructor fails).
         - IfaceILPSpec"Entity":Defines the getters with data that can be
           stored in the entity related to ILP protocol.
         - Iface"Entity": IfaceLocal"Entity" + IfaceILPSpec"Entity"

       - Manager Interfaces (Business logic, Stateless session beans in JEE terminology(>
         - IfaceLocal"Entity"Manager  : Declares the handling methods for the 
           bussiness logic of a local ledger that is not aware of the
           Interledger ILP protocol. That is, a ledger handling local transfer.
           This Local interface is free and independent of any other project appart
           of java-vertx-ledger. It can be changed and modified at will by
           developers. It will not be reused anywhere in any other project.
         
         - IfaceILPSpec"Entity"Manager: Declares the handling methods for the bussiness
           logic of a ledger connected and able to process the Intereldger 
           ILP protocol.
           >>IMPORTANT<<: Ideally all the IfaceILPSpec"Entity"Manager must be moved to
           java-ilp-core so that they can be reused by any other 
           non java-vertx-ledger related project.
         
         - Iface"Entity"Manager: IfaceLocal"Entity"Manager + IfaceILPSpec"Entity"Manager

       - ...everledger.managers:
         - Contains concrete managers clases implementing the 
         Iface"Entity"Manager. That means it will support all specs defined by
         local and ILP interfaces.

- Start-up sequence (REF: ILPLedgerAPIBootUpVerticle.main): 
----------------------------------------------------------

  - STEP 1: Init configuration:
    - (org.interledger.everledger.Config is a read-only/inmutable class 
      used "everywhere". 
    - It's intialized from "application.conf" and from there on, 
      it's always inmutable. (Thread-safe). All ilp-related parameters
      will be contained in the "application.conf" and used by code in 
      a way similar to:
         System.output.println(Config.ilpPrefix);
    - The application neglects to start if Config fails to initialize
      (See fail-fast in coding style).

  - STEP 2: Execute ILPLedgerAPIBootUpVerticle as a VertX verticle.
     (VertxRunner.run(ILPLedgerAPIBootUpVerticle.class);
     
    - VertX will initialize its internal engine and finally invoque and
      ILPLedgerAPIBootUpVerticle.start 
      
      - Will create the "http" routes mapping paths to handlers.

----------------------------------------------------------
This code is designed to be run "single-thread" with many static methods, 
since the purpose was to make code as easy and simple as possible. 
Notice also that scaling through multiple-threads is a patchy solution 
that introduces too much complexity with minor benefits over multiprocess,
the second one having the added advantage of scaling horizontally to many
servers.
